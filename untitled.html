<div>Physical therapy is one of the fields where Robotics is applied.&nbsp; Also, the ankle sprain is a very common injury.</div><div>For physical therapy, special movements are necessary. Such movements include the active and passive range of motion, with special joint speed, acceleration and force. Additionally, they must be gradual and carry a recuperation plan with long and tedious sessions.</div><div>The ankle biomechanical models are a powerful tool in the design of machine-human interaction. They include kinematics and dynamics of all soft tissue, bones, ligaments, surface joints, tendons, muscles, nerves, veins and skin. Such models are complex, in the case of the ankle, the two axes model is commonly accepted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>Parallel robots have advantages for their lightweight, stiffness, efficiency, speed, force and torque distribution. Low mobility parallel robots or restraint movement is an interesting field to study. They can provide security by restraining only the movements reached by the ankle.&nbsp;</div><div> &nbsp;</div><div> </div><div> </div><div> </div>
