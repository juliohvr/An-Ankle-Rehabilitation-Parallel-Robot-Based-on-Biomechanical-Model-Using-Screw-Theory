<div>Physical therapy is one of the fields where Robotics is applied.&nbsp; Also, the ankle sprain is a very common injury.</div><div>For physical therapy, special movements are necessary. Such movements include the active and passive range of motion, with special joint speed, acceleration and force. Additionally, they must be gradual and carry a recuperation plan with long and tedious sessions.</div><div>The ankle biomechanical models are a powerful tool in the design of machine-human interaction. They include kinematics and dynamics of all soft tissue, bones, ligaments, surface joints, tendons, muscles, nerves, veins and skin. Such models are complex, in the case of the ankle, the two axes model is commonly accepted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>Parallel robots have advantages for their lightweight, stiffness, efficiency, speed, force and torque distribution. Low mobility parallel robots or restraint movement is an interesting field to study. They can provide security by restraining only the movements reached by the ankle.&nbsp;</div><div>    </div><pre>Parallel robots have good characteristics as lightweight, stiffness, efficiency, speed, force and torque distribution over the end effector. A special kind of parallel robots with low mobility or restrictions have a lot of new applications in machine tools, legged robots, pick and place robots and many others. They can provide security by restraining only the movements reached by the ankle.&nbsp;</pre><div> </div><pre> Screw theory is a mathematical tool useful and easy for geometrical representation. Resembles the rigid body movement by displacement plus rotation about an axis called screw. Is very useful for analysis and synthesis of closed chains and parallel robots.</pre><div> </div><pre> Compliance is a fundamental concept used in robotics for unstructured ambiances. Types of compliance are passive and active or hybrid.</pre><div> </div><pre> For those reasons, in this work, we purpose an ankle physical therapy parallel robot based on screw theory with compliance.</pre>
