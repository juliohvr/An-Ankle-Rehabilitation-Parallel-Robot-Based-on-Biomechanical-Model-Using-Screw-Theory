<div>An Ankle Rehabilitation Parallel Robot Based on&nbsp; Biomechanical Model Using&nbsp; Screw Theory</div><div>Abstract—This work is about a parallel robot for ankle rehabilitation based on the ankle kinematics. The approach is an application using the ankle joint instantaneous screw. The wrench system reciprocal to the two axes model is used to estimate the screw and adjust the forces and moments corresponding to the natural trajectory of the foot.</div><div>Keywords—parallel robot, ankle model, screw theory, compliance</div><div>Introduction </div><div>Physical therapy is one of the fields where Robotics is applied.&nbsp; Also, the ankle sprain is a very common injury.</div><div>For physical therapy, special movements are necessary. Such movements include the active and passive range of motion with particular joint speed, acceleration and force. Additionally, they must be gradual and follow a recuperation plan with long and tedious sessions.</div><div>An ankle biomechanical model is a useful tool in the design of machine-human interaction. A detailed model includes kinematics and dynamics of all living tissues like bones, ligaments, cartilaginous surface joints, tendons, muscles, nerves, veins and skin. Such models are complex, in the case of the ankle kinematics, is commonly accepted the two axes model.&nbsp; </div><div>Parallel robots have good advantages as lightweight, stiffness, efficiency, speed, force and torque distribution over the end effector. A special kind of parallel robots with low mobility or restrictions have applications in machine tools, legged robots, pick and place robots. They can provide security by restraining only the movements reached by the ankle. </div><div>Screw theory is a mathematical tool useful and easy for geometrical representation. Resembles the rigid body movement by displacement plus rotation about an axis called screw. Is very useful for analysis and synthesis of closed chains and parallel robots.</div><div>Compliance is a fundamental concept used in robotics for unstructured ambiences. Types of compliance are passive, active or hybrid.</div><div>For those reasons, in this work, we purpose an ankle physical therapy parallel robot based on screw theory with compliance.</div>
